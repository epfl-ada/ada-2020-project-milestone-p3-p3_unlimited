      " This is both weird and boring to have this discussion now.  Orlady has cumulatively complained about there being articles on NRHP-listed places a few hundred times to me before.  Here it is misleading for Orlady to assert with sources that \"guided tours of the 'Jonesborough Historic District' are one of the main tourist attractions\" when none of the sources give that name.  I do see one more mention of \"Jonesborough's Historic District\" in one of those, but in fact not a single proper noun naming for the district.  In fact, calling it \"Jonesboro Historic District\" as it was and apparently still is named, provides a nice historical touch reflecting the fact that the town was for much of its history named Jonesboro.  Orlady has argued against use of wiki_links or other coinings of terms elsewhere;  here i think it would be wrong also to coin an artifical term when the quaint historic one is available and documented and accurate. Thanks for those links;  i'll take a look at them.  No thanks for your vote of no confidence that the NRHP document will provide no information on the metes and bounds of the district, on any local arguments for it being listed, and so on.  Good thing i am not looking for your approval, Orlady, in my choosing to work on wikipedia articles in the state of Tennessee.
